# Documentation of the code
This is a school project for a webdev cource at Tampere University of Technology. We did this project in a group of three and the work was distributed equally.

## Project group information
* Persons:
  * Mimmi Matalam√§ki
  * Oskari Lager
  * Ville Saukko

## Pages and navigation
- Login, logout and register pages which are user can sing in, out or register to the service
- After the login the user gets redirected to the the home page. In the home page is displayed various information about the discussions, events and requests that the user might have. 
- User has also a profile page, where can been seen all the information about him. From that page the user can go and to edit-info site, where the data of the user can be changed. In the change data page there is also a link to the page where user can change the password.
- From the home page the user can also navigate to his friends profile pages.
- If the user is not a friend with others person, the user can add friends from the home page, if he know the name of the person user wants to be friends with
- From the home page user can also navigate to discussions which the user is invited to or which the user has created himself
- From the home page user can also create and view the events. User can only see the events he is taking a part in, or the ones, he has created by him self.

## Technological considerations
- The date of birth is formated to djagos datetime, so it must be applied to MM/DD/YYYY
- Discussion timestamp depends on every machines own system time. For example if one user has her system time two hours later than others, other messages will go under her messages because messages goes in chronological order by timestamps.
